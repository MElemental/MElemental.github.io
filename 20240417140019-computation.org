Computation refers to any calculation that is well defined.

* Types of computation

** State Models

*** [[roam:Turing machine]]

*** [[roam:Finite state automaton]]

** Functional Models

*** [[roam:Lambda calculus]]

** [[roam:Connectionism]]
Connectionism refers to a type of computation where a network of perceptual units and gets reweighed after it has been given feedback.
Connectionist models are usually good at pattern recognition and initially poor at logical methods.

* [[roam:Computability]]

Computability refers to the field of mathematics that studies computation.

* [[roam:Turing Completeness]]
