  abstract = {"We often think of our capacity to experience the suffering of others as the ultimate source of goodness. Many of our wisest policy-makers, activists, scientists, and philosophers agree that the only problem with empathy is that we don't have enough of it. Nothing could be farther from the truth, argues Yale researcher Paul Bloom. In Against Empathy, Bloom reveals empathy to be one of the leading motivators of inequality and immorality in society. Far from helping us to improve the lives of others, empathy is a capricious and irrational emotion that appeals to our narrow prejudices. It muddles our judgment and, ironically, often leads to cruelty. We are at our best when we are smart enough not to rely on it, but to draw instead upon a more distanced compassion. Basing his argument on groundbreaking scientific findings, Bloom makes the case that some of the worst decisions made by individuals and nations--whom to give money to, when to go to war, how to respond to climate change, and whom to imprison--are too often motivated by honest, yet misplaced, emotions. With precision and wit, he demonstrates how empathy distorts our judgment in every aspect of our lives, from philanthropy and charity to the justice system and from medical care and education to parenting and marriage. Without empathy, Bloom insists, our decisions would be clearer, fairer, and--yes--ultimately more moral."--Jacket},

  abstract = {Abstract             Palaeontologically, eubacteria are {$>$} 3{\texttimes} older than neomura (eukaryotes, archaebacteria). Cell biology contrasts ancestral eubacterial murein peptidoglycan walls and derived neomuran N-linked glycoprotein coats/walls. Misinterpreting long stems connecting clade neomura to eubacteria on ribosomal sequence trees (plus misinterpreted protein paralogue trees) obscured this historical pattern. Universal multiprotein ribosomal protein (RP) trees, more accurate than rRNA trees, are taxonomically undersampled. To reduce contradictions with genically richer eukaryote trees and improve eubacterial phylogeny, we constructed site-heterogeneous and maximum-likelihood universal three-domain, two-domain, and single-domain trees for 143 eukaryotes (branching now congruent with 187-protein trees), 60 archaebacteria, and 151 taxonomically representative eubacteria, using 51 and 26 RPs. Site-heterogeneous trees greatly improve eubacterial phylogeny and higher classification, e.g. showing gracilicute monophyly, that many `rDNA-phyla' belong in Proteobacteria, and reveal robust new phyla Synthermota and Aquithermota. Monoderm Posibacteria and Mollicutes (two separate wall losses) are both polyphyletic: multiple outer membrane losses in Endobacteria occurred separately from Actinobacteria; neither phylum is related to Chloroflexi, the most divergent prokaryotes, which originated photosynthesis (new model proposed). RP trees support an eozoan root for eukaryotes and are consistent with archaebacteria being their sisters and rooted between Filarchaeota (=Proteoarchaeota, including `Asgardia') and Euryarchaeota sensu-lato (including ultrasimplified `DPANN' whose long branches often distort trees). Two-domain trees group eukaryotes within Planctobacteria, and archaebacteria with Planctobacteria/Sphingobacteria. Integrated molecular/palaeontological evidence favours negibacterial ancestors for neomura and all life. Unique presence of key pre-neomuran characters favours Planctobacteria only as ancestral to neomura, which apparently arose by coevolutionary repercussions (explained here in detail, including RP replacement) of simultaneous outer membrane and murein loss. Planctobacterial C-1 methanotrophic enzymes are likely ancestral to archaebacterial methanogenesis and {$\beta$}-propeller-{$\alpha$}-solenoid proteins to eukaryotic vesicle coats, nuclear-pore-complexes, and intraciliary transport. Planctobacterial chaperone-independent 4/5-protofilament microtubules and MamK actin-ancestors prepared for eukaryote intracellular motility, mitosis, cytokinesis, and phagocytosis. We refute numerous wrong ideas about the universal tree.},

  abstract = {The progress observed in `soft robotics' brought some promising research in flexible tactile, pressure and force sensors, which can be based on polymeric composite materials. Therefore, in this paper, we intend to evaluate the characteristics of a force-sensitive material---polyethylene-carbon composite (Velostat{\textregistered}) by implementing this material into the design of the flexible tactile sensor. We have explored several possibilities to measure the electrical signal and assessed the mechanical and time-dependent properties of this tactile sensor. The response of the sensor was evaluated by performing tests in static, long-term load and cyclic modes. Experimental results of loading cycle measurements revealed the hysteresis and nonlinear properties of the sensor. The transverse resolution of the sensor was defined by measuring the response of the sensor at different distances from the loaded point. Obtained dependencies of the sensor's sensitivity, hysteresis, response time, transversal resolution and deformation on applied compressive force promise a practical possibility to use the polyethylene-carbon composite as a sensitive material for sensors with a single electrode pair or its matrix. The results received from experimental research have defined the area of the possible implementation of the sensor based on a composite material---Velostat{\textregistered}.},

Since the work of Maynard Smith and others, it has been realised how game theory can model this process. Evolutionary game theory replaces the static solutions of classical game theory by a dynamical approach centred not on the concept of rational players but on the population dynamics of behavioural programmes. In this book the authors investigate the nonlinear dynamics of the self-regulation of social and economic behaviour, and of the closely related interactions between species in ecological communities. Replicator equations describe how successful strategies spread and thereby create new conditions which can alter the basis of their success, i.e. to enable us to understand the strategic and genetic foundations of the endless chronicle of invasions and extinctions which punctuate evolution. In short, evolutionary game theory describes when to escalate a conflict, how to elicit cooperation, why to expect a balance of the sexes, and how to understand natural selection in mathematical terms.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the interfacial chain structure and dynamics of confined polymer melt systems under shear over a wide range of flow strengths using atomistic nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, paying particular attention to the rheological influence of the closed-loop ring geometry and short-chain branching. We analyzed the interfacial slip, characteristic molecular mechanisms, and deformed chain conformations in response to the applied flow for linear, ring, short-chain branched (SCB) linear, and SCB ring polyethylene melts. The ring topology generally enlarges the interfacial chain dimension along the neutral direction, enhancing the dynamic friction of interfacial chains moving against the wall in the flow direction. This leads to a relatively smaller degree of slip (ds) for the ring-shaped polymers compared with their linear analogues. Furthermore, short-chain branching generally resulted in more compact and less deformed chain structures via the intrinsically fast random motions of the short branches. The short branches tend to be oriented more perpendicular (i.e., aligned in the neutral direction) than parallel to the backbone, which is mostly aligned in the flow direction, thereby enhancing the dynamic wall friction of the moving interfacial chains toward the flow direction. These features afford a relatively lower ds and less variation in ds in the weak-to-intermediate flow regimes. Accordingly, the interfacial SCB ring system displayed the lowest ds among the studied polymer systems throughout these regimes owing to the synergetic effects of ring geometry and short-chain branching. On the contrary, the structural disturbance exerted by the highly mobile short branches promotes the detachment of interfacial chains from the wall at strong flow fields, which results in steeper increasing behavior of the interfacial slip for the SCB polymers in the strong flow regime compared to the pure linear and ring polymers.},

  abstract = {Humans, like all mammals, depend on the gut microbiome for digestion of cellulose, the main component of plant fiber. However, evidence for cellulose fermentation in the human gut is scarce. We have identified ruminococcal species in the gut microbiota of human populations that assemble functional multienzymatic cellulosome structures capable of degrading plant cell wall polysaccharides. One of these species, which is strongly associated with humans, likely originated in the ruminant gut and was subsequently transferred to the human gut, potentially during domestication where it underwent diversification and diet-related adaptation through the acquisition of genes from other gut microbes. Collectively, these species are abundant and widespread among ancient humans, hunter-gatherers, and rural populations but are rare in populations from industrialized societies thus indicating potential disappearance in response to the westernized lifestyle.           ,              Editor's summary                            The guts of urbanized people worldwide are known to contain less microbial biodiversity than those of humans living rurally. The worry is that the loss of key species contributes to the increasing prevalence of poor metabolic health among urbanized people. By searching for key genes involved in cellulose degradation in metagenome-assembled genomes, Mora{\"i}s               et al               . discovered cellulolytic bacteria in humans. All candidate               Ruminococcus               species assembled active cellulosomes, enzyme complexes capable of degrading microcrystalline cellulose. Three species were distinguished with phylogenies indicating derivation from primate and ruminant hosts, and they showed specific host preferences and ongoing host adaptation. The occurrence of cellulolytic bacteria in humans reveals that a complicated process of dynamic co-evolution occurs in the gut and is possibly regulated by environment. ---Caroline Ash                        ,              Cellulolytic human gut bacteria are scarce in urban societies but abundant in ancient and hunter-gatherer microbiomes.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Mammals, including humans, rely on their gut's microbial community to break down plant cell wall components, notably cellulose and associated polysaccharides. However, there is limited evidence for cellulose fermentation in the human gut despite the benefits of cellulose-containing dietary fiber for gut-microbiome health and overall human well-being.                                         RATIONALE               By investigating the presence of heretofore undescribed bacterial species within the human-gut microbiota that degrade complex cellulosic polysaccharides, we can reveal their potential sources and understand their intricate adaptations to diverse host lifestyles and diets. Insight into the prevalence and abundance of these bacteria across diverse mammalian species and a wide range of human populations will provide critical knowledge of their evolutionary origins, ancestral associations, and trajectories that enabled their incorporation into the human gut.                                         RESULTS                                Previously unknown ruminococcal species were discovered in the human-gut microbiota and provisionally named Candidatus                 Ruminococcus primaciens                 ,                 Ruminococcus hominiciens                 , and                 Ruminococcus ruminiciens                 , all of which assemble functional multienzymatic cellulosome systems that degrade crystalline cellulose. These species are prevalent among the great apes and other nonhuman primates, ancient human societies, hunter-gatherer communities, and rural populations. Although widespread geographically they are conspicuously rare within industrialized societies. Notably, they exhibit distinct host preferences wherein                 R. hominiciens                 is associated primarily with humans and great apes and                 R. primaciens                 predominantly inhabits the gut of nonhuman primates and ancient human populations. Moreover, these species display host-specific diversification, forming distinct clades within the phylogenetic tree and aligning with their respective hosts. Our evolutionary analysis strongly suggests that                 R. hominiciens                 likely originated in the ruminant gut and later transferred to humans, possibly during domestication. High gene expression levels were observed for these species, reflecting their considerable activity in their respective gut systems. Furthermore, their gene expression profile aligns with their hosts' dietary preferences, highlighting their adaptability. Our analyses show that these novel species adapt to their host ecosystems by acquiring genes from co-resident gut microbes. The human-associated strains possess functional adaptability highlighted by the acquisition of genes that can degrade specific plant fibers of monocots such as maize, rice, and wheat---major components of the human diet. Likewise, the nonhuman primate--associated strain exhibits the potential for degrading chitin, a polymer abundant in the insect exoskeleton, part of the diet of nonhuman primates. Our data provide insight into the ongoing colonization of these species within the human gut, particularly those originating from ruminants and nonhuman primates. Specific strains appear to represent intermediates between primate- and rumen-gut ecosystems, as evidenced by their gene content during establishment in the human intestine.                                                        CONCLUSION               Our accumulated data indicate that ruminococcal lineages were more widespread in the past, evidenced by the high prevalence and abundance of these strains in ancient human populations and among hunter gatherer communities and rural societies, combined with their global distribution and low prevalence in industrialized societies. Differences in their prevalence among human populations may reflect dietary variation between industrialized and nonindustrialized societies. Dietary fiber intake appears to be a key factor as high-fiber diets are reported among Hadza hunter-gatherers whereas lower fiber intake is observed in rural populations and the least consumption of fiber occurs in industrialized societies. These findings collectively imply a decline of these species in the human gut, likely influenced by the shift toward westernized lifestyles, potentially impacting energy balance and other health-related aspects. The presence of transitional strains that recently colonized the human gut indicates that ruminants and nonhuman primates could be a source and reservoir for cellulosome-producing ruminococcal strains, which continue to colonize and adapt to the human gut. There may be potential for intentional reintroduction or enrichment of these species in the human gut through targeted dietary approaches and specialized probiotics.                                                   Cellulose degrading gut bacteria of hominids across evolutionary time.                   Previously unknown human gut cellulolytic ruminococcal species are highly prevalent in nonhuman primates, the great apes, ancient human populations, hunter-gatherer communities, and in rural populations but are rare in urbanized human populations.

After it loses stability, the coexistence state gives birth to a stable limit cycle solution created in a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. This attracting periodic solution exists for all the mutation patterns considered, and persists arbitrarily close to the limit of zero mutation rate and a zero-sum game.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to compare the ability of cochlear implant (CI) recipients to recognise speech prosody in the presence of speech-weighted noise to their ability to recognise vowels in the same test paradigm and listening condition. All test materials were recorded from four different speakers (two male, two female). Two prosody recognition tasks were developed, both using single words as stimuli. The first task involved a question/statement distinction, while the second task required listeners to make a judgement about the speaker's attitude. Vowel recognition tests were conducted using vowel pairs selected on the basis of specific acoustic cues (frequencies of the first two formants and duration). Ten CI users and ten normal-hearing controls were tested in both quiet and an adaptive noise condition, using a two-alternative forced-choice test paradigm for all the tests. Results indicated that vowel recognition was significantly better than prosody recognition in both listener groups in both quiet and noise, and that question/statement discrimination was the most difficult task for CI listeners in noise. Data from acoustic analyses were used to interpret differences in performance on different tasks and with different speakers. Learning outcomes: As a result of this activity, readers will be able to (1) describe suitable methods for comparing vowel and prosody perception in noise, (2) compare performance on vowel and prosody perception tasks in quiet in normal-hearing listeners and cochlear implant recipients, (3) compare performance on vowel and prosody perception tasks in noise in normal-hearing listeners and cochlear implant recipients and (4) relate performance on prosody tasks in quiet to performance on these tasks in noise.},
