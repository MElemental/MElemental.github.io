* History

Invented by Tesla.
Criticized by Edison who preferred [[id:83d79a7a-a279-40b7-bc16-48a0320248f3][direct current]]

* Procedure

1. A turbine rotates a magnet.
 - When the magnet is positive it pulls electrons toward the magnet.
    When the magnet is negative it pulls electrons away from the magnet.
    As electrons move they generate current.
2. As the turbine rotates the [[roam:electricity]] moves and generates current that alternates.

   - This current is usually a [[id:387a1422-ff3c-47a9-9ad5-6e5162caaa39][sinusoid wave]] in the [[roam:voltage]] [[roam:range]].
     - This can be visualized as the sine of the pull of the electrons as the magnet rotates.
   - The voltage is the speed the current pulls toward the magnet.
     - The amperage of the circuit is correlated with the size of the wire.
