A science of behavior is possible.
* Paradigm Shifts
Behaviorism originated in John Watsonâ€™s growing conviction that both Jamesian [[roam:functional psychology]] and Wundtian [[roam:introspectionism]] suffered from insufficient empirical grounding and objectivity, largely in consequence of their focus on mental activity or contents [cite:@frankishCambridgeHandbookCognitive2012].
* [[id:6933d2ab-22fb-4c01-ab81-57f7802729e2][radical behaviorism]]
B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism repudiates internal mental states for explaining behavior.
Believed all behavior was a result of operant conditioning.
