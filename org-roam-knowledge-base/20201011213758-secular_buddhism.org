#+title: Secular Buddhism
#+filetags: :suffering:compassion:generalized_compassion:against_empathy:

* Main Ideas
  Secular Buddhism is Buddhist practice that primarily focuses on this life instead of future lives.
  It holds less interest in any supernatural aspects.
  It does still follow the different teachings associated with it.

* My main takeaways
  I find myself interested because of the abandonment of empathy for [[id:b5d89e03-594b-4560-952c-121183db28da][generalized compassion]],
  and the dissolution of the self.
