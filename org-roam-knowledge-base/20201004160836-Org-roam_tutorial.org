#+title: Org-Roam Tutorial File
* Org-roam Tutorial
* Chapter 5 Getting Started
  This is some post install setup stuff.
#+begin_quote
For this tutorial, create an empty directory, and set org-roam-directory:

(make-directory "~/org-roam")
(setq org-roam-directory "~/org-roam")
#+end_quote
I did mine in a different directory. Make the directory

#+begin_quote
We recommend starting org-roam-mode on startup:

(add-hook 'after-init-hook 'org-roam-mode)
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
Let us now create our first note.
Call M-x org-roam-find-file.
This shows a list of titles for notes that reside in org-roam-directory.
It should show nothing right now, since there are no notes in the directory.
Entering the title of the note you wish to create, and pressing RET should begin the note creation process.
This process uses org-captureâ€™s templating system, and can be freely customized (see The Templating System).
Using the default template, pressing C-c C-c finishes the note capture.
Running M-x org-roam-find-file again should show the note you have created, and selecting that entry will bring you to that note.

The crux of Org-roam is making it easy to create notes, and link them together.
To link notes together, we call M-x org-roam-insert.
This brings up a prompt with a list of title for existing notes.
Selecting an existing entry will create and insert a link to the current file.
Entering a non-existent title will create a new note with that title.
Good usage of Org-roam requires liberally linking files: this facilitates building up a dense knowledge graph of inter-connected notes.

Org-roam provides an interface to view backlinks.
It shows backlinks for the currently active Org-roam note, along with some surrounding context.
To toggle the visibility of this buffer, call M-x org-roam.

* Chapter 6 Anatomy of an Org-roam File

  Started in chapter 6 because the Anatomy of an Org-roam File actuall gave things to work with.

** 6.1 Titles and aliases
   See the title and roam_alias org properties for examples.

** 6.2 Tags

*** Variable :: org-roam-tag-sources
    Determines what the tag sources are.
    default value is ='(prop)=
    can be changed to include 'all-directories 'last-directory or 'first directory.

** 6.3 File-refs

   This will have to be revisited later. It includes both org-roam protocol calls and org-ref citations
   Each ref is unique, but I'm not sure if it means 1 to 1 for links to files. they are denoted by the property =#+roam_key=

* Chapter 7 The Templating System
** 7.1
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     ("d" "default"
      plain (function org-roam--capture-get-point)
        "%?"
        :file-name "%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-${slug}"
        :head "#+title: ${title}\n"
        :unnarrowed t)
 #+END_SRC

*** Line 1 is the keystroke and the descrpition

*** Line 2 is the type of template and it's input

*** Line 3 is the template string

*** Line 4 is the file title.

    This is where org-roam-capture starts to get different from org-capture

*** Line 5 is the head or preamble to the org file.

*** Line 6 is an optional parameter that shows the whole file in a capture.

** 7.2
Basically see the main manual [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-expansion.html#Template-expansion][Template expansion (The Org Manual)]]

* Chapter 8 Customization Options Basically

* Chapter 9 Inserting Link
  Since I'm interested in keeping this generally independent of roam, I won't try to use the roam link syntax.
  Therefore I will skip most of this chapter.k

  But it is useful to know org-roam-insert is the function to insert links. I will try that here:

* Chapter 10 Navigating Around
  Some index file which I'm not quite sure what it does yet.

14 Roam Protocol

** roam-file
   Used to make graphs

** roam-ref
   Used for making roam ref's from the browser.
   This is the bookmarklet for accomplishing this.
  #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  javascript:location.href =
'org-protocol://roam-ref?template=r&ref='
+ encodeURIComponent(location.href)
+ '&title='
+ encodeURIComponent(document.title)
#+END_SRC

 [[id:441cd5d3-ab2e-4ae6-b137-706c7ab162f0][Finding Unlinked References (Org-roam User Manual)]]
  This is pretty useful!

* Chapter 18 Performance optimizations
  Not to interested atm

* Look at the appendix
