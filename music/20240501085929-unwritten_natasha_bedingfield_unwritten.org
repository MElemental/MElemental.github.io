* Lyrics
** Verse 1

#+begin_quote
I am unwritten

Can't read my mind

I'm undefined

I'm just beginning

The pen's in my hand

Ending: unplanned
#+end_quote

** Pre-Chorus

#+begin_quote
Staring at the blank page before you

Open up the dirty window

Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find

Reaching for something in the distance

So close you can almost taste it

Release your inhibitions
#+end_quote

** Chorus

#+begin_quote
Feel the rain on your skin

No one else can feel it for you

Only you can let it in

No one else, no one else

Can speak the words on your lips

Drench yourself in words unspoken

Live your life with arms wide open

Today is where your book begins

The rest is still unwritten
#+end_quote

** Post-Chorus

#+begin_quote
Yeah

Oh, oh

#+end_quote
** Verse 2

#+begin_quote
I break tradition

Sometimes my tries

Are outside the lines, yeah, yeah

We've been conditioned

To not make mistakes

But I can't live that way, no, oh
#+end_quote

** Pre-Chorus

#+begin_quote
Staring at the blank page before you

Open up the dirty window

Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find

Reaching for something in the distance

So close you can almost taste it

Release your inhibitions

#+end_quote

** Chorus

#+begin_quote
Feel the rain on your skin

No one else can feel it for you

Only you can let it in

No one else, no one else

Can speak the words on your lips

Drench yourself in words unspoken

Live your life with arms wide open

Today is where your book begins

Feel the rain on your skin

No one else can feel it for you

Only you can let it in

No one else, no one else

Can speak the words on your lips

Drench yourself in words unspoken

Live your life with arms wide open

Today is where your book begins

The rest is still unwritten
#+end_quote

** Post-Chorus

#+begin_quote
Woah

Ooh, oh, woah

Oh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
#+end_quote

** Bridge

#+begin_quote
Staring at the blank page before you

Open up the dirty window

Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find

Reaching for something in the distance

So close you can almost taste it

Release your inhibitions
#+end_quote

** Chorus

#+begin_quote
Feel the rain on your skin

No one else can feel it for you

Only you can let it in

No one else, no one else

Can speak the words on your lips

Drench yourself in words unspoken

Live your life with arms wide open

Today is where your book begins

Feel the rain on your skin

No one else can feel it for you

Only you can let it in

No one else, no one else

Can speak the words on your lips

Drench yourself in words unspoken

Live your life with arms wide open

Today is where your book begins

The rest is still unwritten
#+end_quote

** Outro

#+begin_quote
The rest is still unwritten

The rest is still unwritten

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
