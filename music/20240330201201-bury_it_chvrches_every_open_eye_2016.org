*Verse 1*

Cover up, cover up

Cover up that you're ruthless

Nobody, nobody

Nobody's ever gonna notice

And I am catching on and I am seeing red

How about I prove I'm right and raise it overhead?

*Pre-Chorus*

I never promised you anything I couldn't do

We try to bury it and rise above

Bury it and rise above you, you

You never promised me you would see it differently

Bury it and rise above

Bury it and rise above you, you

*Chorus*

We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above

We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above

[Verse 2]

Reaching, reaching for

Reaching for my resistance

Nobody, nobody

Nobody sees it at a distance

And I am catching up and I am seeing red

How about I throw my weight and raise it overhead?

*Pre-Chorus*

I never promised you anything I couldn't do

We try to bury it and rise above

Bury it and rise above you, you

You never promised me you would see it differently

Bury it and rise above

Bury it and rise above you, you

*Chorus*

We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above

We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above

We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above

We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above

*Interlude*

*Pre-Chorus*

I never promised you anything I couldn't do

We try to bury it and rise above

Bury it and rise above you, you

You never promised me you would see it differently

Bury it and rise above

Bury it and rise above you, you

*Chorus*

We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above

We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above

We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above

We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
