* Lyrics

** Verse 1
#+begin_quote

When you were here before

Couldn't look you in the eye

You're just like an angel

Your skin makes me cry

You float like a feather

In a beautiful world

#+end_quote
** Pre-Chorus
#+begin_quote

I wish I was special

You're so fuckin' special

#+end_quote
** Chorus
#+begin_quote

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo

What the hell am I doing here?

I don't belong here

#+end_quote
** Verse 2
#+begin_quote

I don't care if it hurts

I wanna have control

I want a perfect body

I want a perfect soul

I want you to notice

When I'm not around

#+end_quote
** Pre-Chorus
#+begin_quote

You're so fuckin' special

I wish I was special

#+end_quote
** Chorus
#+begin_quote

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo

What the hell am I doing here?

I don't belong here

Oh-oh, oh-oh

#+end_quote
** Bridge
#+begin_quote

She's running out the door

She's running out

She run, run, run, run

Run

#+end_quote
** Outro
#+begin_quote

Whatever makes you happy

Whatever you want

You're so fuckin' special

I wish I was special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo

What the hell am I doing here?

I don't belong here

I don't belong here
