Pitch is the perception of primarily frequency.
Frequency of sound waves is the sensation detected while musical pitch is the perception experienced.
* Elements of pitch
** Frequency
The amount of cycles per second in a graphical representation of a wave.
While this is the primary determinant of pitch it is not the only determinant of pitch.
** Loudness

  ISO 266:2003 has been withdrawn.
  ISO 266:2023 is the current standard.

*** Amplitude
The height from the equilibrium point in a wave.
Amplitude contributes to our perception of loudness.
Loudness in turn contributes to our perception of pitch.
However amplitude is not the whole story.
