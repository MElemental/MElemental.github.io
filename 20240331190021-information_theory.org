* Origins
Claude Shannon introduced the first seminal paper on information theory in /A Mathematical Theory of Communication/.[cite:@shannonMathematicalTheoryCommunication1948]
* Communication System
[[./img/InformationTheoryCommunicationSystemDiagram.png]]
By a communication system we will mean a system of the type indicated schematically in Fig. 1. It consists of essentially five parts:
** information source
produces a message or sequence of messages to be communicated to the receiving terminal.
information sources can be discrete, continuous, or mixed.

** transmitter
operates on the message in some way to produce a signal suitable for transmission over the channel.

** channel
the medium used to transmit the signal from transmitter to receiver. It may be a pair of wires, a coaxial cable, a band of radio frequencies, a beam of light, etc.

** receiver
performs the inverse operation of that done by the transmitter, reconstructing the message from the signal.

** destination
the person (or thing) for whom the message is intended.

* DISCRETE NOISELESS SYSTEMS
written Languages can be considered a discrete information source.
** Statistics as a structure of information
*** Stochastic Processes
** Markov Chains
