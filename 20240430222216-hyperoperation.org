In mathematics, the hyperoperation sequence is an infinite sequence of arithmetic operations (called hyperoperations in this context) that starts with a unary operation (the successor function with $n = 0$).
The sequence continues with the binary operations of addition $(n = 1)$, multiplication $(n = 2)$, and exponentiation $(n = 3)$.
