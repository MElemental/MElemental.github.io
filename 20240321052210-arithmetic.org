#+TITLE: Arithmetic
#+filetags: :mathematics:arithmetic:

Branch of mathematics concerned with operations. Systems can be distinguished by the set of numbers the system deals with.

* [[id:bfaf8bce-d719-469b-9d78-2ec3fde0d0f7][hyperoperation]]

The following headings are defined in terms of the hyperoperation sequence where $n=0$.
These are the hyperoperations for our most commonly used form of arithmetic.
however other arithmetics can be constructed in [[roam:abstract algebra]].
Additional properties of each operation can be found on their page.

| hyperoperation | primary        | left inverse    | right inverse   | groups introduced |
|----------------+----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-------------------|
| $n = 0$        | successor      | predecessor     | predecessor     | $\mathbb{N}$               |
| $n = 1$        | [[roam:addition]]  | subtraction     | subtraction     | $\mathbb{Z}$               |
| $n = 2$        | multiplication | division        | division        | $\mathbb{Q}$               |
| $n = 3$        | exponentiation | root extraction | [[roam:logarithm]]  | $\mathbb{R}$               |
| $n = 3$        | tetration      | hyper root      | hyper logarithm | $\aleph$               |

** n = 0
*** [[roam:successor function][Succession]]
Succession in a unary operator with arity one.
$\mathbf{S}(n) = n + 1$

** n = 1

*** [[id:e48c630d-f50c-4047-91ed-f1574d9375ce][addition]]
Addition is repeated succession.
# I think there's a bit of a disconnect between these two operations.
# A number is repeated succession, an addition is the combination of two numbers.
*** [[id:c1983e31-a653-41ed-9eee-b33d9418bef8][subtraction]]
subtraction is the inverse operation of addition.
subtraction also introduces the construction of negative numbers.

** n = 2

*** roam:multiplication
Multiplication is the next level of arithmetic hyperoperation.
Multiplication is repeated addition.

*** roam:division
Division is the inverse operation of multiplication.
Division also introduces the construction of rational numbers.

** n = 3

*** roam:exponentiation
exponentiation is repeated multiplication.

*** roam

** n > 3
