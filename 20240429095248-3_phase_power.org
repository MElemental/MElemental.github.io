* Purpose

To get 3 legs of independent power.

* Procedure

3-phase power is three legs of [[id:e73b36c6-55a0-451d-b5b9-0aa49cde7b4c][alternating current]] generated at 120 degree offsets of each other.
The process is similar to single phase alternating current.
Instead of one leg of power being generated on one turbine, there are 3 legs of power offset 120 degrees from each other.
