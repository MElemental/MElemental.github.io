  abstract = {There are two standard ways of peeling an orange: either cut the skin along meridians, or cut it along a spiral. We consider here the second method, and study the shape of the spiral strip, when unfolded on a table. We derive a formula that describes the corresponding flattened-out spiral. Cutting the peel with progressively thinner strip widths, we obtain a sequence of increasingly long spirals. We show that, after rescaling, these spirals tends to a definite shape, known as the Euler spiral. The Euler spiral has applications in many fields of science. In optics, the illumination intensity at a point behind a slit is computed from the distance between two points on the Euler spiral. The Euler spiral also provides optimal curvature for train tracks between a straight run and an upcoming bend. It is striking that it can be also obtained with an orange and a kitchen knife.},

  abstract = {"In the last decade, the science of understanding the human brain and replicating its most complicated processes through artificial intelligence has grown exponentially. Intricate neurological functions ranging from writing poetry to crafting original articles, arenas that had long been thought of as science fiction, have become our reality. And yet, large gaps remain in what AI can achieve-gaps that, as pioneering artificial intelligence entrepreneur Max Bennett argues compellingly, exist because there is still too much we don't understand about our own brains. Finding these answers requires diving into the long billion-year history of how animal brains emerged from matter; a history filled with countless half-starts, calamities, opportunities, and clever innovations. Not only do our brains have a story to tell-in fact the future of AI depends on it. Now, in A Brief History of Brains, Bennett bridges the gap between neuroscience and AI to tell the brain's evolutionary story, while demonstrating how understanding that story will shape the next generation of great AI breakthroughs. Deploying fresh perspective and lively storytelling, Bennett sheds long overdue light on evolutionary neuroscience, a historically small scientific field that holds the keys to the biggest secrets in AI. Working with support from many of the top minds in the field, Bennett consolidates four billion years into an approachable new model, identifying the Five Breakthroughs that mark the brain's most important evolutionary leaps. As we go back further in time, brains get much simpler and behavior gets much simpler, making it easier to understand these ancient brains and the complexity that emerges at each subsequent iteration. As each breakthrough brings new insight to the biggest mysteries of human development, it also contains fascinating corollaries to developments in AI, showing where our technological skill has matched the brain's evolution and where the missing links continue to hold us back. Indeed, until we understand and embrace every part of our brain's journey, parts of AI-including ones that we need to grow and evolve-will remain elusive. Endorsed and lauded by the brightest and best neuroscientists in the field today, Bennett's work synthesizes the most relevant scientific knowledge and cutting-edge research to create an easy-to-understand and riveting evolutionary story. With sweeping scope and stunning insights, A Brief History of Brains proves that understanding the arc of our brain's history can unlock the tools for successfully navigating our technological future"--},

  abstract = {"We often think of our capacity to experience the suffering of others as the ultimate source of goodness. Many of our wisest policy-makers, activists, scientists, and philosophers agree that the only problem with empathy is that we don't have enough of it. Nothing could be farther from the truth, argues Yale researcher Paul Bloom. In Against Empathy, Bloom reveals empathy to be one of the leading motivators of inequality and immorality in society. Far from helping us to improve the lives of others, empathy is a capricious and irrational emotion that appeals to our narrow prejudices. It muddles our judgment and, ironically, often leads to cruelty. We are at our best when we are smart enough not to rely on it, but to draw instead upon a more distanced compassion. Basing his argument on groundbreaking scientific findings, Bloom makes the case that some of the worst decisions made by individuals and nations--whom to give money to, when to go to war, how to respond to climate change, and whom to imprison--are too often motivated by honest, yet misplaced, emotions. With precision and wit, he demonstrates how empathy distorts our judgment in every aspect of our lives, from philanthropy and charity to the justice system and from medical care and education to parenting and marriage. Without empathy, Bloom insists, our decisions would be clearer, fairer, and--yes--ultimately more moral."--Jacket},

  abstract = {Abstract             Palaeontologically, eubacteria are {$>$} 3{\texttimes} older than neomura (eukaryotes, archaebacteria). Cell biology contrasts ancestral eubacterial murein peptidoglycan walls and derived neomuran N-linked glycoprotein coats/walls. Misinterpreting long stems connecting clade neomura to eubacteria on ribosomal sequence trees (plus misinterpreted protein paralogue trees) obscured this historical pattern. Universal multiprotein ribosomal protein (RP) trees, more accurate than rRNA trees, are taxonomically undersampled. To reduce contradictions with genically richer eukaryote trees and improve eubacterial phylogeny, we constructed site-heterogeneous and maximum-likelihood universal three-domain, two-domain, and single-domain trees for 143 eukaryotes (branching now congruent with 187-protein trees), 60 archaebacteria, and 151 taxonomically representative eubacteria, using 51 and 26 RPs. Site-heterogeneous trees greatly improve eubacterial phylogeny and higher classification, e.g. showing gracilicute monophyly, that many `rDNA-phyla' belong in Proteobacteria, and reveal robust new phyla Synthermota and Aquithermota. Monoderm Posibacteria and Mollicutes (two separate wall losses) are both polyphyletic: multiple outer membrane losses in Endobacteria occurred separately from Actinobacteria; neither phylum is related to Chloroflexi, the most divergent prokaryotes, which originated photosynthesis (new model proposed). RP trees support an eozoan root for eukaryotes and are consistent with archaebacteria being their sisters and rooted between Filarchaeota (=Proteoarchaeota, including `Asgardia') and Euryarchaeota sensu-lato (including ultrasimplified `DPANN' whose long branches often distort trees). Two-domain trees group eukaryotes within Planctobacteria, and archaebacteria with Planctobacteria/Sphingobacteria. Integrated molecular/palaeontological evidence favours negibacterial ancestors for neomura and all life. Unique presence of key pre-neomuran characters favours Planctobacteria only as ancestral to neomura, which apparently arose by coevolutionary repercussions (explained here in detail, including RP replacement) of simultaneous outer membrane and murein loss. Planctobacterial C-1 methanotrophic enzymes are likely ancestral to archaebacterial methanogenesis and {$\beta$}-propeller-{$\alpha$}-solenoid proteins to eukaryotic vesicle coats, nuclear-pore-complexes, and intraciliary transport. Planctobacterial chaperone-independent 4/5-protofilament microtubules and MamK actin-ancestors prepared for eukaryote intracellular motility, mitosis, cytokinesis, and phagocytosis. We refute numerous wrong ideas about the universal tree.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Ever since the publication of Shannon's article about information theory, there have been many attempts to apply information theory to the neuroscience field. Meanwhile, the Weber--Fechner law of psychophysics states that the magnitude of a subjective sensation of a person increases in proportion to the logarithm of the intensity of the external physical-stimulus. It is hardly surprising that we assign the amount of information to the response in the Weber--Fechner law. But to date no one has succeeded in applying information theory directly to that law: the direct links between information theory and that response in the Weber--Fechner law have not yet been found. The proposed theory unveils a link between information theory and that response, and differs subtly from the field such as neural coding that involves complicated calculations and models. Because my theory targets the Weber--Fechner law which is a macroscopic phenomenon, this theory does not involve complicated calculations. My theory is expected to mark a new era in the fields of sensory perception research. My theory must be studied in parallel with the fields of microscopic scale such as neural coding. This article ultimately aims to provide the fundamental concepts and their applications so that a new field of research on stimuli and responses can be created.},

  abstract = {Rough speaking, information theory deals with data transmitted over a channel such as the internet. Modern information theory is generally considered to have been founded in 1948 by Shannon in his seminal paper, "A mathematical theory of communication." Shannon's formulation of information theory was an immediate success with communications engineers. Shannon defined mathematically the amount of information transmitted over a channel. The amount of information doesn't mean the number of symbols of data. It depends on occurrence probabilities of symbols of the data. Meanwhile, psychophysics is the study of quantitative relations between psychological events and physical events or, more specifically, between sensations and the stimuli that produce them. It seems that Shannon's information theory bears no relation to psychophysics established by German scientist and philosopher Fechner. Here I show that to our astonishment it is possible to combine two fields. And therefore we come to be capable of measuring mathematically perceptions of the physical stimuli applicable to the Weber-Fechner law. I will define the concept of new entropy. And as a consequence of this, new field will begin life.},

Therefore, in this paper, we intend to evaluate the characteristics of a force-sensitive material---polyethylene-carbon composite (Velostat{\textregistered}) by implementing this material into the design of the flexible tactile sensor. We have explored several possibilities to measure the electrical signal and assessed the mechanical and time-dependent properties of this tactile sensor. The response of the sensor was evaluated by performing tests in static, long-term load and cyclic modes. Experimental results of loading cycle measurements revealed the hysteresis and nonlinear properties of the sensor. The transverse resolution of the sensor was defined by measuring the response of the sensor at different distances from the loaded point. Obtained dependencies of the sensor's sensitivity, hysteresis, response time, transversal resolution and deformation on applied compressive force promise a practical possibility to use the polyethylene-carbon composite as a sensitive material for sensors with a single electrode pair or its matrix. The results received from experimental research have defined the area of the possible implementation of the sensor based on a composite material---Velostat{\textregistered}.},

It is a critical branch of cognitive science, and its influence is increasingly being felt in other areas, including the humanities. AI applications are transforming the way we interact with each other and with our environment, and work in artificially modeling intelligence is offering new insights into the human mind and revealing new forms mentality can take. This volume of original essays presents the state of the art in AI, surveying the foundations of the discipline, major theories of mental architecture, the principal areas of research, and extensions of AI such as artificial life. With a focus on theory rather than technical and applied issues, the volume will be valuable not only to people working in AI, but also to those in other disciplines wanting an authoritative and up-to-date introduction to the field.},

  abstract = {Every form of behaviour is shaped by trial and error. Such stepwise adaptation can occur through individual learning or through natural selection, the basis of evolution. Since the work of Maynard Smith and others, it has been realised how game theory can model this process. Evolutionary game theory replaces the static solutions of classical game theory by a dynamical approach centred not on the concept of rational players but on the population dynamics of behavioural programmes. In this book the authors investigate the nonlinear dynamics of the self-regulation of social and economic behaviour, and of the closely related interactions between species in ecological communities. Replicator equations describe how successful strategies spread and thereby create new conditions which can alter the basis of their success, i.e. to enable us to understand the strategic and genetic foundations of the endless chronicle of invasions and extinctions which punctuate evolution. In short, evolutionary game theory describes when to escalate a conflict, how to elicit cooperation, why to expect a balance of the sexes, and how to understand natural selection in mathematical terms.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the interfacial chain structure and dynamics of confined polymer melt systems under shear over a wide range of flow strengths using atomistic nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, paying particular attention to the rheological influence of the closed-loop ring geometry and short-chain branching. We analyzed the interfacial slip, characteristic molecular mechanisms, and deformed chain conformations in response to the applied flow for linear, ring, short-chain branched (SCB) linear, and SCB ring polyethylene melts. The ring topology generally enlarges the interfacial chain dimension along the neutral direction, enhancing the dynamic friction of interfacial chains moving against the wall in the flow direction. This leads to a relatively smaller degree of slip (ds) for the ring-shaped polymers compared with their linear analogues. Furthermore, short-chain branching generally resulted in more compact and less deformed chain structures via the intrinsically fast random motions of the short branches. The short branches tend to be oriented more perpendicular (i.e., aligned in the neutral direction) than parallel to the backbone, which is mostly aligned in the flow direction, thereby enhancing the dynamic wall friction of the moving interfacial chains toward the flow direction. These features afford a relatively lower ds and less variation in ds in the weak-to-intermediate flow regimes. Accordingly, the interfacial SCB ring system displayed the lowest ds among the studied polymer systems throughout these regimes owing to the synergetic effects of ring geometry and short-chain branching. On the contrary, the structural disturbance exerted by the highly mobile short branches promotes the detachment of interfacial chains from the wall at strong flow fields, which results in steeper increasing behavior of the interfacial slip for the SCB polymers in the strong flow regime compared to the pure linear and ring polymers.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Solid state chemistry has produced a plethora of materials with properties not found in nature. For example, high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates is drastically different from the superconductivity of naturally occurring metals and alloys and is frequently referred to as unconventional. Unconventional superconductivity is also found in other synthetic compounds, such as iron-based and heavy-fermion superconductors. Here, we report compelling evidence of unconventional nodal superconductivity in synthetic samples of Rh               17               S               15               (               T                                c                              = 5.4 K), which is also found in nature as the mineral miassite. We investigated the temperature-dependent variation of the London penetration depth {$\Delta$}               {$\lambda$}               (               T               ) and the disorder evolution of the critical superconducting temperature               T                                c                              and the upper critical field               H                                c                 2                              (               T               ) in single crystalline Rh               17               S               15               . We found a               T               \,-\,linear temperature variation of {$\Delta$}               {$\lambda$}               (               T               ) below 0.3               T                                c                              , which is consistent with the presence of nodal lines in the superconducting gap of Rh               17               S               15               . The nodal character of the superconducting state is supported by the observed suppression of               T                                c                              and               H                                c                 2                              (               T               ) in samples with a controlled level of non-magnetic disorder introduced by 2.5 MeV electron irradiation. We propose a nodal sign-changing superconducting gap in the               A                                1                 g                              irreducible representation, which preserves the cubic symmetry of the crystal and is in excellent agreement with the derived superfluid density. To the best of our knowledge, this establishes miassite as the only mineral known so far that reveals unconventional superconductivity in its clean synthetic form, though it is unlikely that it is present in natural crystals because of unavoidable impurities that quickly destroy nodal superconductivity.},

  abstract = {During the past two decades there has been active interplay between geometric measure theory and Fourier analysis. This book describes part of that development, concentrating on the relationship between the Fourier transform and Hausdorff dimension. The main topics concern applications of the Fourier transform to geometric problems involving Hausdorff dimension, such as Marstrand type projection theorems and Falconer's distance set problem, and the role of Hausdorff dimension in modern Fourier analysis, especially in Kakeya methods and Fourier restriction phenomena. The discussion includes both classical results and recent developments in the area. The author emphasises partial results of important open problems, for example, Falconer's distance set conjecture, the Kakeya conjecture and the Fourier restriction conjecture. Essentially self-contained, this book is suitable for graduate students and researchers in mathematics.},

Methods and Results               Pseudo-lentivirus containing the bovine {$\beta$}-casein promoter and human insulin sequences was used to produce modified adult fibroblasts, and the cells were used for nuclear transfer. Transgenic embryos were transferred to recipient cows, and one pregnancy was produced. Recombinant protein in milk was evaluated using western blotting and mass spectrometry. One transgenic cow was generated, and in milk analysis, two bands were observed in western blotting with a molecular mass corresponding to the proinsulin and insulin. The mass spectrometry analysis showed the presence of human insulin more than proinsulin in the milk, and it identified proteases in the transgenic milk that could convert proinsulin into insulin and insulin-degrading enzyme that could degrade the recombinant protein.                                         Conclusion               The methodologies used for generating the transgenic cow allowed the detection of the production of recombinant protein in the milk at low relative expression compared to milk proteins, using mass spectrometry, which was efficient for detecting recombinant protein with low expression in milk. Milk proteases could act on protein processing converting recombinant protein to functional protein. On the other hand, some milk proteases could act in degrading the recombinant protein.},

  abstract = {Humans, like all mammals, depend on the gut microbiome for digestion of cellulose, the main component of plant fiber. However, evidence for cellulose fermentation in the human gut is scarce. We have identified ruminococcal species in the gut microbiota of human populations that assemble functional multienzymatic cellulosome structures capable of degrading plant cell wall polysaccharides. One of these species, which is strongly associated with humans, likely originated in the ruminant gut and was subsequently transferred to the human gut, potentially during domestication where it underwent diversification and diet-related adaptation through the acquisition of genes from other gut microbes. Collectively, these species are abundant and widespread among ancient humans, hunter-gatherers, and rural populations but are rare in populations from industrialized societies thus indicating potential disappearance in response to the westernized lifestyle.           ,              Editor's summary                            The guts of urbanized people worldwide are known to contain less microbial biodiversity than those of humans living rurally. The worry is that the loss of key species contributes to the increasing prevalence of poor metabolic health among urbanized people. By searching for key genes involved in cellulose degradation in metagenome-assembled genomes, Mora{\"i}s               et al               . discovered cellulolytic bacteria in humans. All candidate               Ruminococcus               species assembled active cellulosomes, enzyme complexes capable of degrading microcrystalline cellulose. Three species were distinguished with phylogenies indicating derivation from primate and ruminant hosts, and they showed specific host preferences and ongoing host adaptation. The occurrence of cellulolytic bacteria in humans reveals that a complicated process of dynamic co-evolution occurs in the gut and is possibly regulated by environment. ---Caroline Ash                        ,              Cellulolytic human gut bacteria are scarce in urban societies but abundant in ancient and hunter-gatherer microbiomes.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Mammals, including humans, rely on their gut's microbial community to break down plant cell wall components, notably cellulose and associated polysaccharides. However, there is limited evidence for cellulose fermentation in the human gut despite the benefits of cellulose-containing dietary fiber for gut-microbiome health and overall human well-being.                                         RATIONALE               By investigating the presence of heretofore undescribed bacterial species within the human-gut microbiota that degrade complex cellulosic polysaccharides, we can reveal their potential sources and understand their intricate adaptations to diverse host lifestyles and diets. Insight into the prevalence and abundance of these bacteria across diverse mammalian species and a wide range of human populations will provide critical knowledge of their evolutionary origins, ancestral associations, and trajectories that enabled their incorporation into the human gut.                                         RESULTS                                Previously unknown ruminococcal species were discovered in the human-gut microbiota and provisionally named Candidatus                 Ruminococcus primaciens                 ,                 Ruminococcus hominiciens                 , and                 Ruminococcus ruminiciens                 , all of which assemble functional multienzymatic cellulosome systems that degrade crystalline cellulose. These species are prevalent among the great apes and other nonhuman primates, ancient human societies, hunter-gatherer communities, and rural populations. Although widespread geographically they are conspicuously rare within industrialized societies. Notably, they exhibit distinct host preferences wherein                 R. hominiciens                 is associated primarily with humans and great apes and                 R. primaciens                 predominantly inhabits the gut of nonhuman primates and ancient human populations. Moreover, these species display host-specific diversification, forming distinct clades within the phylogenetic tree and aligning with their respective hosts. Our evolutionary analysis strongly suggests that                 R. hominiciens                 likely originated in the ruminant gut and later transferred to humans, possibly during domestication. High gene expression levels were observed for these species, reflecting their considerable activity in their respective gut systems. Furthermore, their gene expression profile aligns with their hosts' dietary preferences, highlighting their adaptability. Our analyses show that these novel species adapt to their host ecosystems by acquiring genes from co-resident gut microbes. The human-associated strains possess functional adaptability highlighted by the acquisition of genes that can degrade specific plant fibers of monocots such as maize, rice, and wheat---major components of the human diet. Likewise, the nonhuman primate--associated strain exhibits the potential for degrading chitin, a polymer abundant in the insect exoskeleton, part of the diet of nonhuman primates. Our data provide insight into the ongoing colonization of these species within the human gut, particularly those originating from ruminants and nonhuman primates. Specific strains appear to represent intermediates between primate- and rumen-gut ecosystems, as evidenced by their gene content during establishment in the human intestine.                                                        CONCLUSION               Our accumulated data indicate that ruminococcal lineages were more widespread in the past, evidenced by the high prevalence and abundance of these strains in ancient human populations and among hunter gatherer communities and rural societies, combined with their global distribution and low prevalence in industrialized societies. Differences in their prevalence among human populations may reflect dietary variation between industrialized and nonindustrialized societies. Dietary fiber intake appears to be a key factor as high-fiber diets are reported among Hadza hunter-gatherers whereas lower fiber intake is observed in rural populations and the least consumption of fiber occurs in industrialized societies. These findings collectively imply a decline of these species in the human gut, likely influenced by the shift toward westernized lifestyles, potentially impacting energy balance and other health-related aspects. The presence of transitional strains that recently colonized the human gut indicates that ruminants and nonhuman primates could be a source and reservoir for cellulosome-producing ruminococcal strains, which continue to colonize and adapt to the human gut. There may be potential for intentional reintroduction or enrichment of these species in the human gut through targeted dietary approaches and specialized probiotics.                                                   Cellulose degrading gut bacteria of hominids across evolutionary time.                   Previously unknown human gut cellulolytic ruminococcal species are highly prevalent in nonhuman primates, the great apes, ancient human populations, hunter-gatherer communities, and in rural populations but are rare in urbanized human populations.

  author = {Nizami, Lance},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {K.H. Norwich et al. used Shannon Information Theory to derive their Entropy Theory of Perception (1975-present). The Entropy Theory produces the Entropy Equation, which relates the strength of sensation (represented by magnitude estimates) to the intensity of the sensory stimulus. At ``high'' intensities, the relation is approximately logarithmic, which Norwich et al. dubbed ``the Weber-Fechner Law''. At ``low'' intensities, the relation is approximately a power function, dubbed ``Stevens' Law''. Unfortunately, the Entropy Equation has three unknowns, so that what constitutes ``high'' and ``low'' can only be established through curve-fitting. Remarkably, the latter was never done. Establishing parameter values is especially important because one of the unknowns is a power exponent (the ``Entropy Exponent'', here denoted y) said to be identical in value to ``Stevens' exponent'' (here denoted x). The identity y=x was crucial to the numerous published applications of the Entropy Theory to psychophysical and neurophysiological phenomena. Curve-fitting of the Entropy Equation to magnitude estimates would therefore establish the ranges of the ``Weber-Fechner'' and ``Stevens'' laws and reveal whether y=x. The present author did the curve-fitting, following the custom in the literature: logarithmic forms of the Entropy Equation and Stevens' Law were fitted by least-squares regression to logarithm(magnitude-estimate) vs. logarithm(stimulus-strength) taken from 64 published curves of magnitude estimates. The resulting relation of y to x was broadly scattered; 62/64 times, y exceeded x. In theory, the fitted Entropy Equation allows calculation of the information transmitted in perception. Hence the regressions were re-run conditional to an information transmitted of 2.5 bits/stimulus, the mean value in the literature. y{$\approx$}1.7x under the constrained regression. Altogether, the purported equality of the Entropy Exponent and Stevens' exponent was not confirmed. Further, neither the ``Weber-Fechner Law'' nor the ``Stevens' Law'' derived from any fitted Entropy Equation described the entire range of the respective magnitude estimation curve, contrary to the formal use of those laws. Norwich's later quantification of sensation growth by ``physical entropy'' makes identical mistakes. All of this emphasizes that the Entropy Theory does not derive rules of sensory perception from information theory, and it is recommended that further attempts to do so should be discouraged.},

  abstract = {Ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOM) contribute to one of the largest nitrogen fluxes in the global nitrogen budget. Four distinct lineages of AOM: ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), beta- and gamma-proteobacterial ammonia-oxidizing bacteria ({$\beta$}-AOB and {$\gamma$}-AOB) and complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox), are thought to compete for ammonia as their primary nitrogen substrate. In addition, many AOM species can utilize urea as an alternative energy and nitrogen source through hydrolysis to ammonia. How the coordination of ammonia and urea metabolism in AOM influences their ecology remains poorly understood. Here we use stable isotope tracing, kinetics and transcriptomics experiments to show that representatives of the AOM lineages employ distinct regulatory strategies for ammonia or urea utilization, thereby minimizing direct substrate competition. The tested AOA and comammox species preferentially used ammonia over urea, while {$\beta$}-AOB favoured urea utilization, repressed ammonia transport in the presence of urea and showed higher affinity for urea than for ammonia. Characterized {$\gamma$}-AOB co-utilized both substrates. These results reveal contrasting niche adaptation and coexistence patterns among the major AOM lineages.},

We first answer the important question of why someone should even care about studying graph theory through an application perspective. Afterwards, we introduce definitions and essential terminology in graph theory, followed by a discussion of the types of graphs you may encounter. We then define several ways to represent graphs as a data structure and finish off the video with a discussion of what types of interesting problems you can ask about graphs to help motivate the ideas in future videos.

  abstract = {Looped chord progressions in popular music can often be heard as having multiple plausible key centers. In a series of two experiments, we investigate meter's role as an orienting force within these progressions. Both experiments presented listeners with a progression that looped the C-major, F-major, A-minor, and G-major triads, a series that could plausibly be heard in multiple keys. While the ordering of the triads remained constant across trials, we modified which chord began the loop, thus altering the placement of the initiating metric accent. In Experiment 1, participants heard the loop followed by a probe chord and were asked to rate the probe's stability, a proxy for identifying a key center. In Experiment 2, participants saw a notated loop and were asked to select the most-stable chord. We found a significant effect of metric position and chord identity, with participants rating metric accents and the C major triad as the moststable/centric event. We use these findings to create an algorithmic key-finding model that incorporates both pitch and metric information. Our study argues that metric position has a strong influence on key perception in popular music, challenging an inherited Western-art music bias toward purely pitch-based understandings of musical key.},

Various graph-theoretic patterns of mutation are considered, ranging from a single unidirectional mutation pathway between two of the species, to global bidirectional mutation among all the species. Our main result is that the coexistence state, in which all three species exist in equilibrium, can be destabilized by arbitrarily small mutation rates. After it loses stability, the coexistence state gives birth to a stable limit cycle solution created in a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. This attracting periodic solution exists for all the mutation patterns considered, and persists arbitrarily close to the limit of zero mutation rate and a zero-sum game.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to compare the ability of cochlear implant (CI) recipients to recognise speech prosody in the presence of speech-weighted noise to their ability to recognise vowels in the same test paradigm and listening condition. All test materials were recorded from four different speakers (two male, two female). Two prosody recognition tasks were developed, both using single words as stimuli. The first task involved a question/statement distinction, while the second task required listeners to make a judgement about the speaker's attitude. Vowel recognition tests were conducted using vowel pairs selected on the basis of specific acoustic cues (frequencies of the first two formants and duration). Ten CI users and ten normal-hearing controls were tested in both quiet and an adaptive noise condition, using a two-alternative forced-choice test paradigm for all the tests. Results indicated that vowel recognition was significantly better than prosody recognition in both listener groups in both quiet and noise, and that question/statement discrimination was the most difficult task for CI listeners in noise. Data from acoustic analyses were used to interpret differences in performance on different tasks and with different speakers. Learning outcomes: As a result of this activity, readers will be able to (1) describe suitable methods for comparing vowel and prosody perception in noise, (2) compare performance on vowel and prosody perception tasks in quiet in normal-hearing listeners and cochlear implant recipients, (3) compare performance on vowel and prosody perception tasks in noise in normal-hearing listeners and cochlear implant recipients and (4) relate performance on prosody tasks in quiet to performance on these tasks in noise.},

  abstract = {A theory of speech perception based on evolutionary adaptive postulates is suggested. The principles are grouped around two categories: (a) the physical properties of the stimulus energy and its distributions in the environment; (b) the tendency of the sensory powers to become optimum in order to aid the survival of the species. The construction of the theory and the experiments performed to test its basic predictions are summarized. The theory is examined rather thoroughly with respect to basic vowel space. A line of generalization for the treatment of consonants is indicated.},
